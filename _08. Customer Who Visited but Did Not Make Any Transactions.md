```sql
SELECT 
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM 
    Visits v
LEFT JOIN 
    Transactions t
ON 
    v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE 
    t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 
    v.customer_id;

```



##  Step-by-Step Breakdown (in simple English)
### 🎯 Goal:

Find customers who visited the mall **but didn't make any transactions**, and **how many times** they did that.

---

### 🗂 Step 1: Combine both tables

```sql
FROM Visits v
LEFT JOIN Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
```

* This gives **every visit**, and attaches the transaction **if it exists**.
* If no transaction, columns from `Transactions` will be `NULL`.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Filter visits **with no transactions**

```sql
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
```

* We're interested only in visits **without** a transaction — so filter those.

---

### 📊 Step 3: Group by `customer_id`

```sql
GROUP BY v.customer_id
```

* Now we want to **count how many such visits** each customer made.
* So we **group all the visits** with no transaction by each customer.

---

### 🔢 Step 4: Count such visits

```sql
SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
```

* Now that the visits are grouped by customer, we just **count how many visits** are in each group.
* `COUNT(v.visit_id)` = how many visits this customer made without a transaction.
