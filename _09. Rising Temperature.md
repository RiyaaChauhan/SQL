```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```


###  Problem Summary:
You have a table like this:
| id | recordDate | temperature |
| -- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 2023-01-01 | 30          |
| 2  | 2023-01-02 | 35          |
| 3  | 2023-01-03 | 33          |
| 4  | 2023-01-04 | 37          |

You need to find the **id** where the **temperature was higher than the previous day**.
> Example:
> 2023-01-02 (id=2, temp=35) > 2023-01-01 (temp=30) → ✅ include id = 2
> 2023-01-03 (33) < 35 → ❌
> 2023-01-04 (37) > 33 → ✅ include id = 4

So output should be:

```
| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |
```

### 🔍 So how do we get this?

We want to compare **each row’s temperature** with the temperature from **1 day before**.

---

### ✅ Final query:

```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
  ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

---

### 💡 In Plain English:

* `w1` is "today", `w2` is "yesterday"
* `DATEDIFF(...) = 1`: makes sure you're comparing **consecutive dates**
* Then check: is today's temp > yesterday's?
