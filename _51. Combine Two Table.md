# LeetCode 175: Combine Two Tables
## üìù Problem Description
Write an SQL query to combine two tables and find the names of people along with their addresses, even if they don't have an address.

**Tables**:

#### Person
| PersonId | FirstName | LastName |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1        | John      | Doe      |
| 2        | Jane      | Smith    |

#### Address
| AddressId | PersonId | City     | State   |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1         | 1        | Delhi    | NCR     |
| 2         | 2        | Mumbai   | MH      |

**Expected Output**:

| FirstName | LastName | City  | State |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| John      | Doe      | Delhi | NCR   |
| Jane      | Smith    | Mumbai| MH    |

## üí° Solution Explanation

To solve this problem, we will use a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the two tables. The `LEFT JOIN` will ensure that we get all rows from the `Person` table, along with matching rows from the `Address` table. If no matching address is found, we will still get the person, but with `NULL` values for the address-related columns.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM 
    Person
LEFT JOIN 
    Address
ON 
    Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
```

### Explanation:
1. **SELECT**: We are selecting `FirstName`, `LastName`, `City`, and `State` columns. The first two come from the `Person` table, while the last two come from the `Address` table.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: This ensures that all rows from the `Person` table are returned, even if there is no matching row in the `Address` table. If there is no matching `PersonId` in the `Address` table, `City` and `State` will be `NULL`.
3. **ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId**: This is the condition that links the two tables based on the common `PersonId`.

### Example:
- If a person does not have an address, they will still appear in the result set, but the `City` and `State` columns will be `NULL`.

## üß† Key Concepts:
- **LEFT JOIN**: Combines two tables while retaining all rows from the left table.
- **Handling NULLs**: Rows that don‚Äôt have a match in the right table will show `NULL` for the right table‚Äôs columns.
- **Combining Data**: Using joins to combine data from different sources based on a common identifier.
